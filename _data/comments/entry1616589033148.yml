message: "The pattern measure I truism Gail Dines stand up for, at a colloquy in Boston, she moved the audience to tears with her characterization of the problems caused by pornography, and provoked laughing with her sharp observations roughly pornographers themselves. Activists in the audience were newly inspired, and men at the result – uncountable of whom had not viewed obscenity as a muddle in the vanguard – queued up afterwards to pledge their support. The exhibition highlighted Dines's unsound charisma and the fact that, since the death of Andrea Dworkin, she has risen to that most scabrous and interesting of public roles: the great's foremost anti-pornography campaigner. \r\n \r\n<a href=https://biglesbiantits.org>biglesbiantits</a>"
